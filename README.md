    Run Figx.m to reproduce corresponding results in our paper. The code has been verified on Matlab 2015a, Windows 10  64bit
# History
According to the suggestion of M. Goljan, we rewrite some used functions for speed. The updated version denC2D_fast() should give exactly the same result as denC2D_dwt(). April 9th, 2020, at Binghamton University, SUNY.

## Disclaimer notice ##
    We public this code solely for the convenience of researchers to reproduce our idea accurately and rapidly. Hence, it is for academic use only.
    Some of the codes are modified based on the public codes of Prof. Ivan Selesnick (http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/) and DDE lab(http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/camera_fingerprint/). We thank their contributions and please cite the original work if you find the codes are useful.
